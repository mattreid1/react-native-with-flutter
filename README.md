Integrating React Native into a Flutter app
=====================

[Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) are both cross platform frameworks for developing mobile apps.

Each framework has its own advantages and disadvantages (i.e. Flutter has better performance but React Native is more established and so has better community support). As such, this project aims to combine the best of both worlds by integrating React Native into a Flutter mobile app.

Currently, only the Android implementation works. iOS will be added in the future.

### Android implementation
